NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR - Dist::Zilla like
    PERLANCAR when you build your dists

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.28 of
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::PERLANCAR (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-PERLANCAR), released on 2014-11-08.

SYNOPSIS
     # dist.ini
     [@Author::PERLANCAR]

    is equivalent to (see source).

DESCRIPTION
    The gist:

    I avoid stuffs that might change line numbers (so OurPkgVersion instead
    of PkgVersion, etc). I also always add #ABSTRACT, #PODNAME, and POD at
    the end of file).

    I still maintain dependencies and increase version number manually (so
    no AutoVersion and AutoPrereqs).

    I install my dists after release (the eat-your-own-dog-food principle),
    except when INSTALL=0 environment is specified. I also archive them
    using a script called "archive-perl-release". This is currently a script
    on my computer, you can get them from my 'scripts' github repo but this
    is optional and the release process won't fail if the script does not
    exist.
